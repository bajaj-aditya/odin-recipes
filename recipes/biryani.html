    <p> This traditional Indian rice and chicken mix has more variations than any other Indian dish. Traditionally, this dish is made by marinating chicken or mutton with cottage cheese, mixing aromatic spices with rice, and then slowly cooking for hours. What makes this dish interesting are certain modifications made in different parts of India. Some people keep it classic, while others toss the rice in a pre-cooked sauce to give it a flavorful, moist feel before adding the meat.</p>
