    <p> This delicious charcoal burnt, clay oven-cooked chicken was firstly cooked in Lahore. The fiery red, crispy, and at the same time pulpy dish has taken the world by storm ever since. Although not many restaurants outside India make the original version of the dish, they still perpetuate the elemental flavor, which makes it what it is.</p>
